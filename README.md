# UNet Segmentation App

This project is an end-to-end Python application for semantic segmentation of microscopy images using a UNet model implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress - This project is under active development. Some features may be incomplete or unstable.

## Features

- Data preparation scripts for cropping and organizing images
- UNet model implementation for segmentation
- Training pipeline with configurable parameters
- Evaluation and prediction scripts
- TensorBoard support for monitoring training

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- PyYAML (for configuration parsing)

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
